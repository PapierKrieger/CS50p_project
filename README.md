  # SHORT ESCAPE ROOM GAME
  ### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
  ### Description
  My project is a simple escape room-type game with random player and key position generation as well as variable room size.
  It incorporates the use of classes, libraries, docstrings and console interaction.

  #### How to play
  Open a terminal application and navigate to this projects root folder.
  If you are using Windows 10 or Linux this can be done by right-clicking in this directory and selecting "open in terminal".

  Now enter the following command:
  `python project.py [-x] [N] [-y] [y]`
  where `-x N` and `-y N` are optional arguments which you can give to specify the game area size. If you want this, simply replace "N" with a number between 4 and 30 for each, ending up with something like `python project.py -x 25 -y 15` for instance.

  If you want to quit the game at any point, simply press the escape-key.
